# TranscriptionSuite — Deployment Guide

> Generated: 2026-06-11 | v1.3.6

## Deployment Architecture

TranscriptionSuite deploys as two components:
1. **Dashboard** — Electron desktop app installed on the user's machine
2. **Server** — Docker container running on the same machine or a remote server

## Docker Compose Variants

The server uses a **layered compose** strategy. The dashboard auto-selects the correct combination:

### Base (always included)
- `docker-compose.yml` — Service definition, volumes, environment variables

### Platform Overlays (pick one)
| File | Platform | Networking |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `docker-compose.linux-host.yml` | Linux | Host networking (direct localhost access) |
| `docker-compose.desktop-vm.yml` | macOS / Windows | Bridge + port mapping (9786:9786) |

### GPU Overlays (pick one, optional)
| File | GPU Type | Mechanism |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `docker-compose.gpu.yml` | NVIDIA (legacy) | `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` with nvidia driver |
| `docker-compose.gpu-cdi.yml` | NVIDIA (CDI) | CDI device passthrough (`nvidia.com/gpu=all`) |
| `docker-compose.vulkan.yml` | AMD / Intel (Linux) | whisper.cpp sidecar with `/dev/dri` Vulkan access |
| `docker-compose.vulkan-wsl2.yml` | AMD / Intel (Windows + WSL2) | whisper.cpp sidecar via `/dev/dxg` GPU-PV (locally-built image) |
| `podman-compose.gpu.yml` | NVIDIA (Podman) | Podman-specific GPU passthrough |

> **8 compose files total** (base + 5 platform/GPU overlays + podman + vulkan-wsl2). The Vulkan-WSL2 path
> is opt-in and never enters auto-selection — it requires the locally-built
> `transcriptionsuite/whisper-cpp-vulkan-wsl2:latest` sidecar (`server/docker/build-vulkan-wsl2.{sh,ps1}`),
> which is **not** published to GHCR.

### Common Combinations
```bash
# Linux + NVIDIA GPU (most common)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.linux-host.yml \
  -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d

# macOS / Windows CPU
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.desktop-vm.yml up -d

# Linux + AMD/Intel GPU (Vulkan)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.linux-host.yml \
  -f docker-compose.vulkan.yml up -d
```

## Docker Volumes

| Volume Name | Mount Point | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| `transcriptionsuite-data` | `/data` | Database, audio files, tokens, logs |
| `transcriptionsuite-models` | `/models` | HuggingFace model cache (~2-30GB) |
| `transcriptionsuite-runtime` | `/runtime` | Python venv, bootstrap state, uv cache |

**Bind mounts** (optional):
| Source | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `USER_CONFIG_DIR` | `/user-config` | Custom config.yaml and logs |
| `TLS_CERT_PATH` | `/certs/cert.crt` | TLS certificate (read-only) |
| `TLS_KEY_PATH` | `/certs/cert.key` | TLS private key (read-only) |
| `STARTUP_EVENTS_DIR` | `/startup-events` | Bootstrap progress for Electron |

## Bootstrap System

On first container start, the server installs Python dependencies into `/runtime/.venv`:

1. **Fingerprint check** — Compare schema version, Python ABI, arch, GPU driver, extras, uv.lock
2. **Cache hit** — Skip install if fingerprint matches
3. **Cache miss** — Run `uv sync --frozen` with appropriate extras
4. **Status file** — Write `bootstrap-status.json` with installed features
5. **Startup events** — Emit progress to JSONL file for dashboard

**Extras selected by model type:**
- Whisper model → `--extra whisper`
- NeMo model → `--extra nemo` (requires `INSTALL_NEMO=true`)
- VibeVoice model → `--extra vibevoice_asr` (requires `INSTALL_VIBEVOICE_ASR=true`)

**Timeout:** 30 minutes default (`BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800`)

### TLS interception / corporate network (`UnknownIssuer`)

If first-run `uv sync` fails with `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer`,
`certificate verify failed`, or `server certificate verification failed.
CAfile: none` (a git clone), something is intercepting HTTPS and re-signing it
with a certificate the container does not trust.

**Why it works in your browser but not here.** The interceptor's root CA is
installed in your *host's* trust store. Docker does not copy the host trust store
into containers, so every HTTPS client inside the container rejects the re-signed
certificate. Nothing is wrong with your Docker install or your image.

Certificate verification stays ON throughout. Never disable it.

#### 1. First, rule out your antivirus (most home users stop here)

Consumer security suites ship an HTTPS-scanning feature that is **on by default**
and does exactly this interception. Turn it off and start the server again:

| Product | Setting to disable |
|---|---|
| ESET | Web and email → SSL/TLS → *Enable SSL/TLS protocol filtering* |
| Kaspersky | Settings → Network → *Do not scan encrypted connections* |
| Avast / AVG | Protection → Core Shields → *Enable HTTPS scanning* |
| Bitdefender | Protection → Online Threat Prevention → *Encrypted Web Scan* |
| Avira | Web Protection → *Scan HTTPS connections* |

Corporate laptops with a managed proxy (Zscaler, Netskope, Fortinet, a company
CA) cannot do this. Use step 2.

#### 2. Give the container the intercepting root CA

Export the root CA, put it in a folder **of its own**, and point
`EXTRA_CA_CERTS_DIR` at that folder. The entrypoint installs everything it finds
there into the container trust store at startup, before any download runs.

Export it on Windows with PowerShell (no admin rights needed):

```powershell
$dir = "$env:APPDATA\TranscriptionSuite\ca"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dir | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\Root, Cert:\CurrentUser\Root | ForEach-Object {
  "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"
  [Convert]::ToBase64String($_.RawData, [Base64FormattingOptions]::InsertLineBreaks)
  "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
} | Set-Content -Encoding ascii "$dir\host-roots.crt"
```

Then set `EXTRA_CA_CERTS_DIR=%APPDATA%\TranscriptionSuite\ca` and restart the
server. (This exports every root your OS already trusts, which necessarily
includes the interceptor's. If you prefer to trust only that one CA, export it
alone from `certmgr.msc` → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → right-click
→ All Tasks → Export → **Base-64 encoded X.509** and drop the file in that
folder instead.)

On Linux/macOS the equivalent is any directory containing your CA:
`EXTRA_CA_CERTS_DIR=~/.config/TranscriptionSuite/ca`.

Running a bare Docker Engine inside WSL2 (no Docker Desktop, reached via
`DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...`)? The dashboard only translates the paths it builds
itself (config dir, TLS certs, startup events) to their `/mnt/c/...` WSL2
equivalent. `EXTRA_CA_CERTS_DIR` is a value you type in yourself, so supply
the WSL2-shaped path directly, e.g. `EXTRA_CA_CERTS_DIR=/mnt/c/Users/<you>/AppData/Roaming/TranscriptionSuite/ca`.

Accepted file extensions are `.crt`, `.pem` and `.cer`; PEM bundles holding many
certificates are split automatically. Files that are not PEM (a DER export) are
skipped with a warning rather than corrupting the trust store.

Behind a corporate proxy you likely also need `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and
`NO_PROXY`, which are passed through to the container.

> **Why one folder covers everything.** The install path spans three trust
> stores: uv reads `SSL_CERT_FILE`, the `git` subprocess uv uses for git-sourced
> dependencies reads `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`, and the `requests` client HuggingFace uses

`UV_NATIVE_TLS=true` remains available but is no longer something you need to
set: once a CA is installed, uv switches to the system trust store on its own.

CPU-only hosts hit this most often because the default install pulls multi-GB
CUDA wheels. Selecting the **CPU profile** in the dashboard (or
`PYTORCH_VARIANT=cpu`) skips those wheels and shrinks the download surface.
A whisper/nemo-only CPU install no longer needs any git access — the VibeVoice
git dependency is resolved from declared metadata, not cloned (GH #125).

## TLS / Remote Access

### Tailscale Setup
```bash
# 1. Generate certificates
tailscale cert your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net

# 2. Start with TLS
TLS_ENABLED=true \
TLS_CERT_PATH=~/.config/Tailscale/your-machine.crt \
TLS_KEY_PATH=~/.config/Tailscale/your-machine.key \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.linux-host.yml \
  -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
```

When TLS is enabled:
- All routes require Bearer token authentication (except `/health`, `/api/auth/login`)
- Admin token generated on first run (shown in server logs)
- Dashboard auto-detects token from Docker log output

## GPU Requirements

### NVIDIA CUDA
- CUDA 12.9+ (explicit PyPI index override for PyTorch)
- nvidia-container-toolkit or nvidia-container-runtime
- 6-16GB VRAM depending on model
- CDI mode available for newer setups
- **Modern GPUs only** — the default image ships PyTorch cu129 wheels, which
  support compute capability `sm_70..sm_120` (Volta and newer: RTX 20/30/40/50,
  Tesla V100/A100/H100, data-centre L4/L40, etc.). Pascal (GTX 10-series) and
  Maxwell (GTX 9-series, Tesla M40) are **not** supported by the default image —
  see [Legacy-GPU image variant](#legacy-gpu-image-variant-issue-83) below.

### Legacy-GPU image variant (Issue #83)

Users with Pascal (`sm_6x`) or Maxwell (`sm_5x`) cards — e.g. **GTX 1070, GTX
1080, Tesla P4/P40/P100, Tesla M40** — need the `-legacy` image, which is
built against PyTorch cu126 wheels (still ships `sm_50..sm_90`). The cu129
wheels rebuilt with these cards were dropped upstream; that's why Issue #60's
compute-type auto-correction doesn't help — PyTorch rejects the GPU outright
before the backend can downgrade `float16` to `int8`.

**Enable it via the dashboard:**
Server settings → Runtime = **GPU (CUDA)** → flip the **"Use legacy-GPU image
(GTX 10-series / 900-series and older)"** toggle (only visible when the CUDA
runtime is selected). The dashboard switches to the
`ghcr.io/homelab-00/transcriptionsuite-server-legacy` repo for the remainder
of the session; confirm the restart prompt to wipe the runtime volume so the
next bootstrap re-syncs wheels from the cu126 index.

**Build & push it manually:**
```bash
# From the repo root — build locally with the cu126 build-arg, then push to the
# -legacy GHCR repo. The default `docker compose build` is unaffected.
./build/docker-build-push.sh --variant legacy --build v1.3.4
```
`--variant legacy` flips both the build-arg (`PYTORCH_VARIANT=cu126`) and the
push target (`…/transcriptionsuite-server-legacy`). `latest` is auto-tagged
only within its own repo, never across the two.

**Post-push smoke check (mandatory on first push of a new package).**
GHCR defaults first-push visibility to `Private`, which produces a 403 on
anonymous pulls and misroutes in the dashboard. The script now prints a
reminder on every push; on the **first** push of a newly created GHCR package
(e.g. the initial `-legacy` publish for v1.3.3), flip the package to Public
at `https://github.com/users/homelab-00/packages/container/<pkg>/settings`
and then run the anonymous-pull smoke check from a shell with no GHCR creds:

```bash
docker logout ghcr.io
docker pull ghcr.io/homelab-00/transcriptionsuite-server-legacy:v1.3.4
```

If the pull succeeds, the image is externally reachable. If it 403s, the
package is still Private — fix visibility before announcing the release.
This single step catches both the GHCR private-default failure mode *and*
the "forgot to push one of the tags" variant.

**Caveats:**
- First-run bootstrap takes longer than the default variant — the legacy path
  runs `uv sync` without `--frozen` because `uv.lock` pins wheel hashes to the
  cu129 index. It does a fresh resolve + download against cu126.
- Reproducibility guarantees are weaker for this variant only.
- Not available in `release.yml` — the legacy image is published manually by
  the maintainer (consistent with the existing Docker publishing flow).

**Manual `compose build`: `IMAGE_REPO` and `PYTORCH_VARIANT` must be paired.**
`server/docker/docker-compose.yml` reads both through env vars with independent
defaults (`IMAGE_REPO=…-server`, `PYTORCH_VARIANT=cu129`). Setting only one
locally produces a misleading image — the tag claims one variant while the
installed wheels are the other. The dashboard never calls `compose build` (it
always `docker pull`s pre-built images), so this footgun only affects manual
CLI workflows. Rule of thumb:

```bash
# Default (modern GPUs) — both defaults apply; nothing to export.
docker compose build

# Legacy (Pascal/Maxwell) — export BOTH, never one in isolation:
IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/homelab-00/transcriptionsuite-server-legacy \
PYTORCH_VARIANT=cu126 \
docker compose build
```

`server/docker/start-common.sh` inspects the resolved image on startup and
prints a warning if the baked `PYTORCH_VARIANT` does not match the repo
implied by `IMAGE_REPO`, so a mismatched build is surfaced before you spend
an hour debugging a cryptic CUDA error on first transcription.

**Grandfathering existing users through GH-83 (Blind #10).** The runtime
bootstrap fingerprint absorbed `pytorch_variant` in GH-83. To avoid forcing
every existing cu129 user to pay a full `uv sync` rebuild on the upgrade,
`bootstrap_runtime.py` treats a pre-GH-83 marker (no `pytorch_variant` field)
as implicitly cu129 and recomputes the legacy fingerprint form; if it
matches, the marker is rewritten in place and the next boot takes the fast
hash-match-skip path. Users flipping to cu126 still rebuild — only the
non-flipping cu129 path is zero-cost.

### AMD/Intel Vulkan
- **Linux:** Vulkan-capable GPU with `/dev/dri` access; whisper.cpp sidecar (`ghcr.io/homelab-00/whisper-cpp-linux` — our no-AVX2 rebuild of upstream `main-vulkan`, so the sidecar runs on pre-Haswell CPUs too)
- **Windows + WSL2 (experimental, opt-in):** GPU paravirtualization via `/dev/dxg`; forces Mesa's `dzn` (Vulkan-on-D3D12)
  ICD to avoid silent CPU fallback. Requires the locally-built `vulkan-wsl2` sidecar image and Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend.
  The dashboard surfaces a separate "GPU (Vulkan WSL2 — experimental)" option only when WSL2 + `/dev/dxg` are both detected.
- Quantized GGUF models only (lower VRAM requirement)

### Apple Silicon (Metal)
- MLX framework (no Docker needed)
- Setup via `build/setup-macos-metal.sh`
- Creates self-contained `.app` with bundled Python venv

- **Readiness:** `GET /ready` (200 when models loaded, 503 when loading)
- **Status:** `GET /api/status` (detailed: GPU, model, features, config)
- **Docker healthcheck:** curl to `/health` every 30s, 600s start period

## Security

- Non-root container user (`appuser`, UID 10000)
- Token-based auth with SHA-256 hashing (TLS mode)
- Origin validation middleware (CORS policy)
- Stop grace period: 130s (matches 120s drain timeout)
- GPG-signed release artifacts (optional)

## CI/CD Release Pipeline

Triggered by `v*` tag push (manual `workflow_dispatch` adds a **platform selector**:
`all`/`macos-metal`/`macos`/`linux`/`windows`):
1. **build-linux** — AppImage + GPG signature
2. **build-windows** — NSIS installer + GPG signature (3x retry)
3. **build-macos** — DMG + ZIP + GPG signatures
4. **build-macos-metal** — Apple Silicon Metal bundle (sealed last to keep the codesign valid, GH #154)
5. **create-release** — Draft GitHub Release with all artifacts (+ update manifest for the auto-updater)

## Keychain fallback (encrypted-file mode)

The Audio Notebook QoL pack stores private profile fields (webhook tokens,
API keys, custom auth headers) in the OS-native keychain by default —
macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, or Linux libsecret. On hosts where no OS
keychain is available (headless Docker, minimal Linux containers, CI
runners), set the env flag below to enable an explicit file-encrypted
fallback.

### Enabling the fallback

```bash
KEYRING_BACKEND_FALLBACK=encrypted_file
```

The first time this flag is honoured, the server generates
`secrets/master.key` (32 bytes, hex-encoded, mode 0600) and uses it as
the password for `keyrings.alt.file.EncryptedKeyring`. Stored values
land in `secrets/encrypted_keyring.cfg`.

In Docker, bind-mount the `/secrets` directory so the key + encrypted
store survive container rebuilds:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./secrets:/app/secrets
```

### Security delta — what the fallback DOES protect against

- **Casual disk inspection** — values are AES-encrypted at rest; opening
  `encrypted_keyring.cfg` in a text editor reveals nothing useful.
- **Cloud-sync exposure** — if `secrets/` is excluded from your sync (as
  it should be), the encrypted store never leaves the host.
- **Database dumps** — private values are never in `notebook.db`.

### Security delta — what the fallback does NOT protect against

- **Local attacker with `secrets/master.key` access.** The master key is
  stored unencrypted on the host filesystem. Any process that can read
  the key file can decrypt every value in `encrypted_keyring.cfg`. The
  OS-native keychain is the authoritative recommendation for desktop
  installs because it does not have this property.
- **Memory inspection.** Decrypted values pass through process memory
  during use; this is true of any in-process secret store.
- **Backup tooling that snapshots `secrets/`.** Treat `secrets/master.key`
  as you would treat a password file: exclude from generic file-system
  backups, or back up to an audited secret-management system instead.

### Refusing the fallback

If `KEYRING_BACKEND_FALLBACK` is NOT set and no OS keychain is available,
the keychain wrapper raises `KeychainUnavailableError` with the
deployment-guide pointer in the message — the server never silently
stores secrets in plaintext (NFR8).
